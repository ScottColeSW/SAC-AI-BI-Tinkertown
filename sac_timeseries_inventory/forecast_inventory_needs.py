# Four Types of Inventory Forecasting
# There are four basic approaches you may consider for inventory forecasting.

# Trend forecasting: Project possible trends using changes in demand for your product over time. This doesnâ€™t always account for seasonality or other irregularities in past sales data.
# Graphical forecasting: By graphing historic data, you can identify patterns and add slopped trend lines to identify possible insights that may have been missed without the visual representation.
# Qualitative forecasting: Qualitative forecasting usually involves focus groups and market research. Forecasters then flesh out models from this type of data.
# Quantitative forecasting: This uses past numerical data to predict future demand. The more data gathered, the more accurate the forecast usually is.
